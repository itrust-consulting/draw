  |**Testcase description** |  Create a DRAW Basic Graph |
  |**Verification method**  |  Test                   |
  |**Requirements covered** |                     |
  |**Testsetup**            |  DRAW v2.0.5 on Microsoft Edge                      |

  |**Step#**  | **Step Action**          | **Expected Results**|
  |-----------|--------------------------|---------------------|
  |  **1** | Create a graph as in image  ![Alt text](../../images/Graph1.png "Basic Graph")   |                     |
  |  **2** | Save the graph as JSON and compare with ..\\tests\\tests_manual\\graph1.json         |  JSON files match                  |
  |  **3** | DropDownRight of Open->Clear Working Area        |  Graph is cleared                  |
  |  **4** | Create a graph as in image  ![Alt text](../../images/graph_cyclic.png "Cyclic Graph")   |                     |
  |  **5** | Save the graph as JSON and compare with ..\\tests\\tests_manual\\graph_cyclic.json         |  JSON files match                  |
  |  **6** | DropDownRight of Open->Clear Working Area        |  Graph is cleared                  |
  | **7** | Create a graph as in image  ![Alt text](../../images/graph_same_name.png "Same Name of Assets Graph")   |  Tool allows to create the graph                   |
  | **8** | Save the graph as JSON and compare with ..\\tests\\tests_manual\\graph_same_name.json         |  This will not match through graphdiff.py and comparison needs to be done visually  |
  | **9** | DropDownRight of Open->Clear Working Area        |  Graph is cleared                  |

  |**Test pass-fail criteria** | The saved JSON file matches the expected JSON files in steps 2, 4, 7  |
