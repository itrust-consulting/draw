  The tool shall provide interface to synchronize with trick service instances (app or trickservice or demo) and enable the user to
  compare risk estimations by comparing the Impact/Likelihood as defined by Trick Service with New Impact/Likelihood computed based on
  propogation of risk from one asset to another using the dependency graph propogation rates.
  --- 
  - The tool shall generate a report at the end of comparison (report.html and report.csv)
  - The generate report shall contain the following fields for each asset scenario combination:

    ---
    - **Asset**: This field represents the asset name as defined in Graph/Trick Service.
    - **Scenario**: This field represents the corresponding scenario for the given asset.
    - **Old Likelihood**: This field represents the Likelihood for asset/scenario combination as fetched from Trick Service assessment.
    - **New Likelihood**: This field represents the Likelihood for asset/scenario combination as computed by DRAW. 
       This takes into account the probability of the edge from one asset to another (propagation probability) 
       along with likelihood values fetched from Trick Service for the asset/sceanrio combination. The new Likelihood 
       is the sum total of likelihood of damage starting somewhere else and propagating at the given asset and 
       contributing to damage done to the given asset. 
       The new Likelihood is determined as sum of old likelihood and the sum of products of likelihood and the probability 
       of propagation. 

      Computation of Likelihood of damage for directly connected assets can be computed as below

      ** Likelihood of damage of Assets connected through Path of length 1 ** 
      If the assets are connected to current asset with a single path then the
      new Likelihood can be computed as Old Likelihood + Sum of Product of Likelihood of damage of connected asset on the given asset
      
      **Refer figure below for illustration.**

      ![Fig1. Likelihood of damage of Assets connected through Path of length 1](images/LikelihoodOfLength1.png)

      `New Likelihood of A1 = Old Likelihood of A1`

      New Likelihood of A2 = Old Likelihood of A2 + Likelihood of A1 * Probability of impact of A1 on A2

      `New Likelihood of A2 = L2 + L1 *Pr12`

      New Likelihood of A3 = Old Likelihood of A3 + Likelihood of A1 * Probability of impact of A1 on A3

      `New Likelihood of A3 = L3 + L1 *Pr13`

      ** Likelihood of Assets connected through Path of length > 1 **

      Consider the following figure where the assets are connected through path of length > 1 and and there are multiple paths
      between assets A1 and A3.

      ![Fig 2. Likelihood of damage of Assets connected through Path of length >1](images/LikelihoodOfLengthN.png)

      New Likelihood of A1 = Old Likelihood of A1 

      `New Likelihood of A1 = L1`

      New Likelihood of A2 = Old Likelihood of A2 + Likelihood on A1  * Likelihood of impact of damage of A1 on A2

      `New Likelihood of A2 = L2 + L1 * Pr12`

      New Likelihood of A4 = Old Likelihood of A4 + Likelihood on A1  * Likelihood of impact of damage of A1 on A4

      `New Likelihood of A4 = L4 + L1 * Pr14`

      New Likelihood of A3 = Old Likelihood of A3 + Likelihood on A2 * Probability of Impact of A2 on A3 + Impact on A4 * Probability of Impact of A4 on A3 + Impact on A1 * Probability of Impact of A1 on A3`

      `New Likelihood of A3 = L3 + L2 * Pr23 + L4 * Pr43 + L1 * (Pr13A + Pr13B)`
      
      `New Likelihood of A3 = L3 + L2 * Pr23 + L4 * Pr43 + L1 * (Pr12*Pr23+ Pr14*Pr43)`

     
    - **Old Impact**: This field represents the Impact for asset/scenario combination as fetched from Trick Service assessment.
    - **New Impact**: This field represents the computed impact for asset/scenario combination as computed by DRAW. The new impact 
    is computed based on the impacts on all assets that might be damaged as a consequence of damage starting at the given asset. 
    The algorithm to determine new impact determines the new impact as a function of old impact and the probability of propagation 
    of impacted assets.
    Computation of Probability of Impact for directly connected assets can be computed as below:

      ** Impact of Assets connected through Path of length 1 ** : 
      If the Impacting assets are connected to current asset with a single path then the
      new Impact can be computed as Old Impact + Sum of Product of Impact of Connected asset with Probability of Impact 
      
      **Refer figure below for illustration.**

      ![Fig 3. Impact of Assets connected through Path of length 1](images/ImpactConnectionofLength1.png)

      `New Impact on A1 = Old Impact on A1 +  
      Impact on A2 * Probability of Impact of A2 on A1 + Impact on A3 * Probability of Impact of A3 on A1`
      
      `New Impact on A1 = I1 + I2 * Pr12 + I3 * Pr13`
      
      ** Impact of Assets connected through Path of length > 1 ** : 
      
      Consider the following example where the assets are connected through path of length > 1 and and there are multiple paths
      between assets A1 and A3.

      ![Fig 4. Impact of Assets connected through Path of length >1](images/ImpactConnectionofLengthN.png)
            
      New Impact on A1 = Old Impact on A1 + Impact on A2 * Probability of Impact of A2 on A1 + Impact on A4 * Probability of Impact of A4 on A1 + Impact on A3 * Probability of Impact of A3 on A1

      `New Impact on A1 = I1 + A2 * Pr12 + I4 * Pr14 + I 3 * (Pr13A + Pr13B)`
      `New Impact on A1 = I1 + A2 * Pr12 + I4 * Pr14 + I 3 * (Pr12 * Pr23 + Pr14 * Pr43)`
    
  While computing the New Impact or New Likelihood the tool will require to compute the reachability matrix and impact probability between assets which are connected 
  through multiple edges and multiple paths. In doing so the tool may encounter cycles and in order to avoid cycles the tool shall use a probabilistic algorithm
  for determining reachability matrix and impact probability.
  The tool shall simulate about 1 million situations, in which propagation decisions are randomly taken, and averages the overall result. 
  Thus rounding errors are expected in the results generated.
