   The update dependency graph feature will update the dependency graph on trick service using the connected nodes in DRAW white board which have been synchronized with Trick Service earlier. 
   All unconnected asset nodes which are not synchronized with DRAW previously are ignored. 
   However if a connected asset node is found in DRAW which has not been synchronized with Trick Service earlier will result in an error.
   Implying that asset is not present in Trick Service already.
