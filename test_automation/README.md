#  Contents of this Directory:
    This directory contains the tests and the robot automation framework for
    automated testing of DRAW tool. 

    Directories are structured as below:

  - tests : This directory contains the Excel/JSON files used by robot  framework during testing
  - customLibraries : This directory conatins the custom libraries (.python files) used by robot framework for testing.
  - resources: This directory contains the resources (.robot files) frequently used by robot test suit for testing. 
  - robotTestSuit: This directory contains the robot files for testing. More files can be added to the testsuit as per the need and feature. 
  - output: This directory contains the report and log files generated by robot tool
  - downloads: This directory is used during testing as a download directory.
  - testlogging: This directory contains the log files generated during testing

  Before running the robot tests the following directories should be clean:
  - downloads:
  - testlogging:

# Standard Robot Framework

The files in directory robotTestSuit are derived from
- [Robot Framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/robot-framework/basics) syntax.
- Robot can be configured by `robot.yaml`.
- Dependencies can be configued in `conda.yaml`.

## Learning material for robot framework

- [Robocorp Developer Training Courses](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses)
- [Documentation links on Robot Framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/robot-framework)
- [Example bots in Robocorp Portal](https://robocorp.com/portal)

## Commands for running robot from CLI:

### Parallel testing and CLI options

####  pabot tool
  Use pabot tool for parallel testing of robot:
  Plugin for parallel testing:

  `$ pip3 install robotframework-pabot`

  Parallel running tests:

  `$ pabot [path to tests]`

  Run testcases within a file in parallel mode:

  `$pabot --testlevelsplit [path to split]`

#### CLI options

  Run only a single test:

  `$ robot -t "Testcase name" testFile.robot`

  Runs all robot files :
  `$ robot . `

  Regular expressions also work with paths: 

  `$robot -t "Validate*" `

  Tag testcases as below:

  Example in RObot file:
  
  Add tag in RObot file:

  Validate Test1
	   [Tags]	SMOKE

  Now Run tags as below:

  `$ robot --include <tagname> .`

  More examples:

  `$ robot --include <tagname>  AND <tagname> . `

  `$robot --exclude <tagname> .`

  `$robot --suit <foldermame>`

  `$robot --rerunfailed output.xml .`
